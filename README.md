Explainable AI helps humans understand how the model makes a decision. Developers can perform black-box or white-box testing to understand the model's behavior and get insights about the model. Those insights can guide the developer to increase the model's performance.

The YOLOv8 model from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) was used to perform the black box and white box testing.
